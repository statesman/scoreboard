### Teamplayer integration

This app relies on two TeamPlayer templates, one Web template, and one query template. Both are included below so changes to Teamplayer templates can be tracked along with changes to the app's code.

The production version of the app draws from the Web template `TickerJSON` and the dev version from `TickerJSON_clone`. Production queries are generated by `Ticker` and dev come from `TickerClone`.

#### Web template
```php
<QUERY name=Sport SPORTID=$form_Sport>
<VAR $market = "">
<IFGREATER $form_Market 0>
<VAR $market = $form_Market>
</IFGREATER>
<?PHP $scoreFields = array("Football" => "TotalPoints",
"Baseball" => "Runs",
"Boys Basketball" => "TotalPoints",
"Girls Basketball" => "TotalPoints",
"Boys Hockey" => "TotalGoals",
"Girls Hockey" => "TotalGoals",
"Boys Soccer" => "TotalGoals",
"Girls Soccer" => "TotalGoals",
"Boys Volleyball" => "FinalScore",
"Girls Volleyball" => "FinalScore",
"Field Hockey" => "TotalGoals",
"Softball" => "Runs",
"Boys Lacrosse" => "TotalGoals",
"Girls Lacrosse" => "TotalGoals"); ?>
<?PHP $periodTrans = array("1st quarter" => "Q1",
"2nd quarter" => "Q2",
"3rd quarter" => "Q3",
"4th quarter" => "Q4",
"Overtime" => "OT",
"" => ""); ?>
<VAR $sportName = $Sport_SportName>
<VAR $sqlSportName = strtolower(convertForSQL($sportName))>
<VAR $scoreField = $scoreFields[$sportName]>
<QUERY name=TickerClone SPORTID=$form_Sport SPORTNAME=$sqlSportName SCOREFIELD=$scoreField STARTDATE=$form_StartDate ENDDATE=$form_EndDate MARKET=$market>
<?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?>

<?php
$json = json_encode($TickerClone_rows);
if(array_key_exists('callback', $_GET)){
    $callback = $_GET['callback'];
    $json = $callback . '(' . $json . ');';
}
echo $json;
?>
```

#### Query template
