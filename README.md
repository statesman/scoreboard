### Configuration

All configuration settings are stored in [`src/js/config.js`](src/js/config.js).

Setting up the regular season is as simple as setting the two variables at the top of that file, one for the number of weeks in the regular season and another for the first Friday of the regular season, which is what all of the other weeks will be calculated from.

You'll also need to include the base URL for your teamplayer gateway and the sport ID for football.

```javascript
var numWeeks = 11;
var firstFriday = moment('2014-08-29', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
var urlBase = 'http://teamplayer.statesman.com';
var sportId = '1';
```

### Teamplayer integration

This app relies on two TeamPlayer templates, one Web template, and one query template. Both are included below so changes to Teamplayer templates can be tracked along with changes to the app's code.

The production version of the app draws from the Web template `TickerJSON` and the dev version from `TickerJSON_clone`. Production queries are generated by `Ticker` and dev come from `TickerClone`.
